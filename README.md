# ATMConfigurator
ATM Configurator aka Tyupkin trojan

Configurator.exe compiles executable file that will later be installed on ATM.
During configuration you can set up 7-digit PIN-code that will open ‘service mode’ and give the name for executable file. This code is later entered on ATM in stand-by mode.

‘Service mode’ has the following menu:
- Show cash info
- Dispense cash
- Erase all

!!! You need to have physical access to USB port or any other drive inside ATM to run compiled *.exe file. Installation is automatic. Right after the installation (30-50 seconds) the ATM will reboot.
!!! Works only on ATMs under Windows XP.

After the reboot your ‘service code’ can be used to control ATM.

Price for the program is 500 btc. No negotiations.
You send the request to atmconfigurator@tutanota.de > We send you btc address > After 3 confirmations on blockchain we send you the configurator.zip
